# Computer Science Repository 

## Description 
I am a computer science student at Austin Community College. This GitHub repository is a list of all my assignments and homework as well as projects that I have and will accomplish during my time of studying.

## Future 
In the future I am looking to build out some of the projects that I have started or one day look back upon my programming journey.
