15. 1994 Weekly Gas Graph
In the student sample programs for this book,
you will find a text file named 1994_Weekly_Gas_Averages.txt.
The file contains the average gas price for each week in the year 1994.
(There are 52 lines in the file.) Using matplotlib,
write a Python program that reads the contents of the file then
plots the data as either a line graph or a bar chart.
Be sure to display meaningful labels along the X and Y axes,
as well as the tick marks.
