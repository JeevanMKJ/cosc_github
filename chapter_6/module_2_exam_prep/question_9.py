9. Write an IPO chart for a function called calc_circle_is_bigger_than_square
that receives as arguments the radius of a circle and the length of the side of a square.
The function should return three things: a Boolean that indicates whether the area of
the circle is greater than the area of the square and the areas of the two shapes.
