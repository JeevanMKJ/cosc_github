1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500
my name is Zach.

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,833
I work full time at a marketing agency.

3
00:00:02,833 --> 00:00:05,433
At Bad Marketing,
as a direct response copywriter.

4
00:00:05,666 --> 00:00:06,800
I mostly do email copy,

5
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,133
but I do a little of in between

6
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,033
And then I have a couple of freelance

7
00:00:10,033 --> 00:00:11,866
clients on the side as well. Awesome.

8
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,300
And what's been your

9
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:14,800
experience in Genesis so far?

10
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,500
My experience has been awesome.

11
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,900
Like, I've been in Genesis,

12
00:00:18,466 --> 00:00:20,366
I think since, like, the first month
you guys launched.

13
00:00:20,533 --> 00:00:22,433
In between all the trainings

14
00:00:22,433 --> 00:00:23,866
and the feedbacks,
like, it's been incredible.

15
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,566
And with all the new AI stuff, it's

16
00:00:25,566 --> 00:00:28,500
been awesome because balancing

17
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,166
the agency work with freelance clients
and having all these bots makes

18
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:33,700
everything faster for me
so I can get more work done in less time.

19
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,566
But it's still top quality work.

20
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,033
I just landed a new client,

21
00:00:37,566 --> 00:00:39,366
a couple months ago,
after going through, like,

22
00:00:39,366 --> 00:00:41,800
a whole death match week by week
kind of scenario,

23
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:43,600
using the bots to

24
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,200
to help me get a bunch of work
done in less time.

25
00:00:45,533 --> 00:00:46,966
And I think

26
00:00:46,966 --> 00:00:48,266
the coolest thing for me is like,

27
00:00:48,866 --> 00:00:49,766
no matter what

28
00:00:49,766 --> 00:00:52,366
project I want to try and tackle,
there's a plethora

29
00:00:52,366 --> 00:00:55,000
of trainings
or videos or bots at my disposal.

30
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,466
So even though I usually do email stuff,

31
00:00:56,733 --> 00:00:58,000
if I want to get into VSL’s

32
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,733
or ads or advertorials or anything

33
00:00:59,733 --> 00:01:01,033
in between like I've got,

34
00:01:01,066 --> 00:01:02,133
you know, nearly

35
00:01:02,133 --> 00:01:03,566
unlimited resources at my disposal.

36
00:01:04,233 --> 00:01:05,066
Amazing.

37
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:05,866
And what has been

38
00:01:05,866 --> 00:01:08,366
the most valuable part of Genesis?

39
00:01:08,966 --> 00:01:10,100
I think when I first started,

40
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,700
the most valuable part
was the feedback on my copy.

41
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,066
Like I'd be able to submit copy and stuff

42
00:01:14,066 --> 00:01:15,333
like that.

43
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,766
Kind of ongoing.

44
00:01:16,766 --> 00:01:18,733
It's just been like some of the core
trainings you guys have done.

45
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,000
And like,
there's still some that I go back to

46
00:01:21,233 --> 00:01:23,433
and reference different frameworks
or examples, like all the time.

47
00:01:23,733 --> 00:01:26,033
And then most recently, for me,
just with my workload

48
00:01:26,033 --> 00:01:27,866
expanding, it's been all the AI bots.

49
00:01:28,366 --> 00:01:29,400
nice

50
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,433
Do you have a favorite bot
or workflow of bots

51
00:01:31,433 --> 00:01:32,733
that you use?

52
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,366
I mostly use the click driver bot.

53
00:01:35,766 --> 00:01:38,266
Because like one of my clients
that I write for, it's very short,

54
00:01:38,266 --> 00:01:40,166
punchy, like Clickbank style offers

55
00:01:40,366 --> 00:01:41,666
and it works awesome.

56
00:01:41,766 --> 00:01:44,666
Lately, I've used like the Mario
and the Luke bot a lot just to like

57
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:46,700
as my own little marketing strategist

58
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,700
So like I'm trying to figure out how
I want to organize something.

59
00:01:48,966 --> 00:01:50,000
It's a really great resource

60
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,266
to go back and forth
with someone like instantaneously.

61
00:01:52,533 --> 00:01:54,033
So Amazing.

62
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,600
I don't know any, any results or anything

63
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,900
tangible that you able to do,

64
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:58,033
with Genesis, with the bots?

65
00:01:58,533 --> 00:01:58,666
Yeah.

66
00:01:58,666 --> 00:02:01,333
I mean, well, so through the agency job
alone,

67
00:02:01,733 --> 00:02:03,833
like between all my clients, I’ve generated

68
00:02:04,033 --> 00:02:05,333
like seven figures in revenue,

69
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:06,466
which was like a big thing for me

70
00:02:06,466 --> 00:02:07,766
because, like, now I call myself a seven

71
00:02:07,766 --> 00:02:09,066
figure, you know, copywriter.

72
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:10,633
And all of that is basically

73
00:02:10,633 --> 00:02:11,933
a byproduct of, like,

74
00:02:11,933 --> 00:02:13,733
where I am now as a copywriter compared to

75
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:15,033
I think it was almost three years ago

76
00:02:15,033 --> 00:02:16,400
that I joined,

77
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,700
it's like night and day difference.

78
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,133
And then being able to work with some of

79
00:02:20,133 --> 00:02:21,766
the bigger named people in the industry

80
00:02:22,033 --> 00:02:23,333
based on the merit of my copy is

81
00:02:23,733 --> 00:02:25,133
is pretty cool. Awesome.

82
00:02:25,433 --> 00:02:26,533
You were also able to win

83
00:02:26,533 --> 00:02:29,533
a copywriting challenge as well.

84
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:30,866
Correct? Yeah.

85
00:02:30,866 --> 00:02:31,533
Nice and what.

86
00:02:31,533 --> 00:02:32,666
Yeah. What was that challenge?

87
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:33,666
So basically it was like

88
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:35,033
four weeks, and then every week

89
00:02:35,033 --> 00:02:36,400
we had to write
like a set number of emails.

90
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,633
And those emails
kind of increased in terms of the amount.

91
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:40,533
and they were
also for different offers.

92
00:02:40,533 --> 00:02:42,266
So I was able to use
like the copyblock stuff,

93
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:44,033
that you guys talk about

94
00:02:44,066 --> 00:02:45,333
and the click driver’s emails

95
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:47,133
just to quickly get it done.

96
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,833
Because we had to get it done

97
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:50,766
from like Tuesday to Friday,
I think was the timeframe.

98
00:02:51,933 --> 00:02:53,233
And week over week.

99
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,933
Yeah. I just kept passing on
and then I won.

100
00:02:55,233 --> 00:02:57,333
And since then, I've written
some pretty good bangers for them.

101
00:02:57,466 --> 00:02:58,700
So that's awesome.

102
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,766
Yeah, that's such
a huge accomplishment.

103
00:03:00,766 --> 00:03:02,233
So I think you had a win
every week, right?

104
00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:03,700
You know, I had to like. Yeah.

105
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,133
It was like top emails move on.

106
00:03:05,133 --> 00:03:07,333
So, like,
I was chosen out of, like, 80 people

107
00:03:07,733 --> 00:03:08,900
like to be in the final eight

108
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,200
or whatever to do this thing.

109
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,933
And then I was the
the winner by the end of it.

110
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,933
That's awesome. Yeah, that's key.

111
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:16,466
And that's the thing that I see with AI
and with the bots in general, is

112
00:03:16,466 --> 00:03:18,833
It just amplifies
whatever talent that you have

113
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:20,300
and allows you to do more at scale

114
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,600
and with more volume.

115
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,833
And go deeper with stuff.

116
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:23,933
That's been my experience at least.

117
00:03:23,933 --> 00:03:25,633
So that's an awesome accomplishment.

118
00:03:26,133 --> 00:03:26,300
Cool.

119
00:03:27,533 --> 00:03:30,233
your experience just overall
with the community, with the culture,

120
00:03:30,233 --> 00:03:32,900
with the trainings inside of Genesis
as compared with,

121
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,466
other trainings or other programs

122
00:03:35,433 --> 00:03:36,066
the community is great.

123
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:38,366
I mean, and to be fair, like,
I probably don't even interact in it

124
00:03:38,366 --> 00:03:40,133
as much as I could
and I would definitely

125
00:03:40,133 --> 00:03:41,433
get more benefit from it.

126
00:03:41,466 --> 00:03:43,266
the community is great,
like between you and Mario

127
00:03:43,266 --> 00:03:44,666
and then just everybody else in it

128
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:46,166
it's like a very supportive.

129
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:47,800
You know sometimes

130
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,266
like some of these other communities
I've been in like

131
00:03:49,266 --> 00:03:51,766
it feels a little cutthroat or like other
people are trying to always pitch you

132
00:03:51,766 --> 00:03:53,900
something or, I don’t know
it doesn't seem as genuine.

133
00:03:54,566 --> 00:03:56,600
But that hasn't been my experience
with Genesis.

134
00:03:56,633 --> 00:03:57,766
it's been pretty great.

135
00:03:57,766 --> 00:03:59,066
And again, like, it's

136
00:03:59,066 --> 00:04:01,533
another resource where
I can go pose a question to the group.

137
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,900
And before you or Mario
even have a chance to get to it,

138
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:05,433
like I'll have several other people,

139
00:04:05,766 --> 00:04:07,033
you know, jumping in and

140
00:04:07,033 --> 00:04:08,900
and dropping their thoughts
and help and stuff.

141
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,166
Awesome.

142
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,733
I mean, and anything else

143
00:04:11,733 --> 00:04:13,266
that you want to share
about your experience

144
00:04:13,266 --> 00:04:14,566
or you think would be helpful

145
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,433
for somebody
who's considering joining Genesis?

146
00:04:16,933 --> 00:04:17,433
I would do it.

147
00:04:17,433 --> 00:04:18,766
I mean, whether you're a freelancer,

148
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,966
just kind of an all-around marketer,

149
00:04:20,966 --> 00:04:22,766
or even if it's just your launching
your own business.

150
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:24,133
Again, I've been a member

151
00:04:24,133 --> 00:04:25,433
for almost three years.

152
00:04:25,433 --> 00:04:28,033
I've never once considered canceling

153
00:04:28,066 --> 00:04:30,466
My ROI has been infinite.

154
00:04:30,466 --> 00:04:32,766
I mean, just landing the one gig for me
kind of pays off

155
00:04:32,766 --> 00:04:34,466
almost the entire three years
in and of itself.

156
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:37,100
So, I think it's totally worth it.

157
00:04:37,433 --> 00:04:39,000
Just the amount of guys,
the amount of stuff

158
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,300
you guys put in there.

159
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,633
I can't imagine anybody interested in
marketing would join it

160
00:04:42,633 --> 00:04:44,966
and not be overwhelmed with,

161
00:04:45,266 --> 00:04:46,566
you know, opportunities.
